# Greyhound-Modelling
# Looking at how to web scrape, 
# probably using beautiful soup,
# Greyhound racing data from around the world
# but starting with one track in the UK
# looking to come up with models to compare their speed
# over different the course distances, trap numbers and
# how many corners they go around etc etc
